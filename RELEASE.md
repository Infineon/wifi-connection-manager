# Wi-Fi Connection Manager (WCM)

## What's Included?
See the [README.md](./README.md) for a complete description of the Wi-Fi Connection Manager.

## Known Issues
| Problem | Workaround |
| ------- | ---------- |
| The `cy_wcm_deinit` API does not bring down the network stack as the default underlying lwIP stack does not have an implementation for deinit. Therefore, the expectation is that `cy_wcm_init` and `cy_wcm_deinit` APIs should be invoked only once. | No workaround. Support will be added in a future release. |
