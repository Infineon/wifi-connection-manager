# Cypress Wi-Fi Connection Manager (WCM)
WCM is a library which helps application developers to manage Wi-Fi Connectivity. The library provides a set of APIs that can be used to establish and monitor Wi-Fi connections on Cypress platforms that support Wi-Fi connectivity.

The library APIs are thread-safe. The library monitors the Wi-Fi connection and can notifies connection state changes through an event notification mechanism. The library also provides APIs to connect to a Wi-Fi network using Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS)  methods.

## Features and Functionality
The current implementation has the following features and functionality:
* Supports only STA mode. AP and Concurrent AP + STA modes will be added in future.
* Support for WPS - Enrollee role.
* Exposes Wi-Fi APIs to scan, join, and leave the Wi-Fi network.
* Connection monitoring: Monitors active connections and link events. Automatically reconnects to the AP if the connection with the AP is lost intermittently. Notifies connection state change through an event notification registration mechanism.
* This library is part of AnyCloud framework that supports connectivity applications based on FreeRTOS, lwIP, and mbed TLS.
* The library is built on top of the abstraction-rtos library that provides the RTOS abstraction API for FreeRTOS.


## Supported Platforms
This library and its features are supported on the following Cypress platforms:
* [PSoC 6 Wi-Fi BT Prototyping Kit (CY8CPROTO-062-4343W)](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/psoc-6-wi-fi-bt-prototyping-kit-cy8cproto-062-4343w)
* [PSoC 62S2 Wi-Fi BT Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062S2-43012)](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/psoc-62s2-wi-fi-bt-pioneer-kit-cy8ckit-062s2-43012)

## Dependent Libraries
This library depends on the following:
* [Wi-Fi Middleware Core](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/wifi-mw-core)
* [Wi-Fi Host Driver](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/wifi-host-driver)

## Quick Start
* A set of pre-defined configuration files have been bundled with the wifi-mw-core library for FreeRTOS, lwIP, and mbed TLS. The developer is expected to review the configuration and make adjustments. See the "Quick Start" section in [README.md](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/wifi-mw-core/blob/master/README.md).

* A set of COMPONENTS must be defined in the code example project's Makefile for this library. See the "Quick Start" section in [README.md](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/wifi-mw-core/blob/master/README.md).

* The WCM library disables all the debug log messages by default. To enable log messages, the application must perform the following:

 - Add the `ENABLE_WCM_LOGS` macro to the *DEFINES* in the code example's Makefile. The Makefile entry would look like as follows:
  ```
  DEFINES+=ENABLE_WCM_LOGS
  ```
 
 - Call the `cy_log_init()` function provided by the *cy-log* module. cy-log is part of the *connectivity-utilities* library. 
 
 - See [connectivity-utilities library API documentation](https://cypresssemiconductorco.github.io/connectivity-utilities/api_reference_manual/html/group__logging__utils.html).
